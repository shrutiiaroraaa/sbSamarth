सबSamarth is a potential public empowerment app to be developed and designed to improve and systamise information flow hence improving transparency and efficiency of the workflow of any concerned authority.

As depicted by its name, the app/ website attempts to empower every citizen by making information accessible and authorities easily approachable to them via a user friendly communication channel. This app/ website also focuses on bringing the works of authorities to light and enables people to verify them(works) personally and potentially anonymously hence improving the overall transparency of the workflow.

FUNCTIONING

It authenticates using Aadhar. Every user has a “profile” and “What's happening” pages  सबSamarth makes you a part of a digital network corresponding to where you live, hence creating a digital society. It showcases the hierarchy of authorities in your area to make them more recognizable and approachable.

The core functioning of this app is based on “posting” of location centric possible improvements and addressing problems transparency.

If an “issue” is posted by someone, it can be backed up by people living nearby hence determining the overall severity/importance of the issue. People can then support the cause and take a legal approach to address the issue together, while it is visible to everyone. This intends to bring in more people working towards the process of improvement in our societies. One shares issues that have been noted or addressed in other regions, making flow of good ideas faster.

When an issue is resolved by anyone in the society(verified by the masses) it shows the same on one's profile, giving them credibility in the society. Problems unaddressed yet severe and well documented may be automatically transferred to a person of higher power, within a given amount of time making insincerity accountable.

This app/website wishes to develop a more transparent form of e-governance, if promoted by the government. It craves to reduce corruption and improve regional development.


USE CASES AND PROBLEMS TACKLED

Following listed are some of the use case(s) of सबSamarth.
Person A has an idea to solve a problem, they notice that the improper management of wires on electric poles is increasing and causing more pole fires then ever, also, spoiling the aesthetics of the region. Instead of submitting this problem as a physical document, or sharing it on a whatsapp group he chooses to post it on सबSamarth. The document is viewed by many people of his region. People “Upvote” the problem improving the credibility of the post. Person B suggests that their society should implement a regulation to wire any new Broadband connections keenly and if not done so the connections might suffer termination. Person C suggests that over the next few months people with improper connections should be given a window of time to ask their service providers to make a keen rewiring. Person D suggests underground cabling to be implemented.The idea is simultaneously viewed by position of power and guided toward the physical proceedings to implement it.

As the idea flows through people, it gets refined unlike if Person A had submitted the same via a physical method.

A few days later Person X from a completely different background comes across this issue on their “What’s happening” page and finds it to be a relevant issue. He is inspired and shares the same with people of his region. People again find the same relevant and start working on solving the issue while they have an example set by the previous society and they know just the people to reach out to if needed guidance.

Messaging apps like Whatsapp though offer a great communication service, but are limited to closed groups. If person B had chosen to share his idea through Whatsapp, information flow wouldn’t have been so smooth. This makes सबSamarth a proper channel and gives it an edge over mainstream information flow apps.
